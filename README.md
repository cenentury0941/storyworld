## Our Marketting Approach

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cenentury0941/Pictures/main/Market2.png" alt="drawing" width="700">

Our marketting approach of our submission for the hackathon involded us reaching out to our college to interact with our juniors and to spread the word of AI generated multi branch story telling as a tech demo. They were so thrilled with the demonstration that they allowed us to share our link on the college's whatsapp groups which allowed our main stories comprising of 39 of our initial submissions to gain a large amount of traction. It also helped to have a younger brother who shared our links at his school cyber club, helping us further spread the word.

We never aimed to go past the 39 story mark however, we had to improvise due to the changing algorithm and countering spam.


## Our VR Integration

Our original goal was to develop a fully VR integrated solution that brought the power of XR and computer graphics to bring stories to life, however we've put that on the back burner for now as it wasn't a part of the eveluation metrics.
